About Me
======
I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor advised by Nikhil Bansal.  I am interested in algorithms and discrete math. I have spent some time thinking about problems in streaming algorithms, query complexity, discrepancy theory and clustering. Before coming to Ann Arbor, I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati and was lucky to have Benny George as my thesis Advisor. 

I fell in love with Theoretical Computer Science when I attended PACT 2019, a program conducted by Rajiv Gandhi. In the summer of 2020, I was very fortunate to work with  Sepehr Assadi from Rutgers University on the problem of estimating quantiles in the streaming setting. The following summer, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with David Woodruff from CMU on understanding the query complexity of a generalized version of the mastermind problem.
