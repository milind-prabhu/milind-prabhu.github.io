I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://theory.engin.umich.edu/) advised by [Nikhil Bansal](https://bansal.engin.umich.edu/).  I work in theoretical computer science and discrete math. I enjoy thinking about problems in approximation algorithms, streaming, etc.  Before coming to Ann Arbor, I completed my B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/cse/). 


My journey in TCS began when I attended [PACT](https://algorithmicthinking.org/) 2019, a program conducted by [Rajiv Gandhi](https://crab.rutgers.edu/users/rajivg/) to introduce high-school and undergraduate students to TCS. As an undergrad, I was extremely fortunate to spend time working during various summers with [Sepehr Assadi](https://sepehr.assadi.info/), [David Woodruff](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/), and my undergrad advisor, [Benny George Kenkireth](https://www.iitg.ac.in/ben/). 

Here is a link to my [CV](https://milind-prabhu.github.io/files/resume.pdf).
