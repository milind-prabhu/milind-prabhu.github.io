#Bio
I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor advised by Nikhil Bansal.  I am interested in algorithms and discrete math. I have spent some time thinking about problems in streaming algorithms, query complexity, discrepancy theory and clustering. Before coming to Ann Arbor, I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.
