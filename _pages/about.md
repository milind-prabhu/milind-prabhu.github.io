I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor advised by [Nikhil Bansal](https://bansal.engin.umich.edu/).  I work in theoretical computer science and discrete math. I enjoy thinking about problems in approximation algorithms, streaming, etc.  Before coming to Ann Arbor, I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. 


My journey in Theoretical Computer Science began when I attended PACT 2019, a program conducted by Rajiv Gandhi. As an undergrad, I was extremely fortunate to spend time working during various summers with Sepehr Assadi, David Woodruff, and my undergrad advisor Benny George Kenkireth.
